# MineralExploration
This is the code for the intelligent prospector mineral exploration work conducted at Stanford University in a collaboration with SISL and SCERF. The source code provides a simulated mineral exploration problem and an implementation of the proposed sequential solution framework. The scripts needed to run the published experiments and additional trials are included in the `scripts` directory. All experiments were run in Julia 1.6.x. The specific versions of the required support packages are listed in the `project.toml`. 

## Installation 
The package can be installed using the standard Julia package manager utility `add` function. To add the package from a local source, simply run the command (from within the package manager environment) 

```
] add /PATH_TO_SOURCE
```
 alternatively, you may navigate to the home directory of the source and run 
 ```
 ] add . 
 ```
 If you would like to develop within the code base, we recommend building the source directly within a virtual environment. The required packages can be installed using the Julia `build` command from the source home directory. 

## Code Organization
All of the source code is in the `src` directory. The `MineralExploration.jl` file defines the main module strucutre. In this file, the source for all of the exposed structures and functions can be located. The `parameters` directory contains the data used to fit the variograms in the published experiments. The `scripts` directory contains the scripts to run the expeirments and tests. 

## Example Use
The `solve_pomcpow.jl` script provides the best example of how to use this codebase. Key snippets are provided here.

    discounted_return += POMDPs.discount(m)^(t - 1)*r
end
```
In the above code, `...` denotes code from the original script that was omitted for brevity here. 

Note: To save data, the default location is a `data` folder in the source code home directory. To change this, change the file path strings referenced in the script.
